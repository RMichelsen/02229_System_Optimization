- Clean up code
	- Helper method for adding variables to the cp model
	- Wrappers for addition / multiplication / division
	- Split into more files (maybe solvers in separate file)
	- Dictionary lookups are a bit ugly, maybe do something great instead

- Fix model
	- Arrival patterns are 0, seems wrong
		- Assuming "c" refers to a cycle in the range 1..3, the input to the arrival pattern
		  function is negative. This seems in unintended.
		- Period seems very large compared to cycle and alpha numbers, even after multiplying
		  with the cycle length.
